# Adcash
A program that takes a list of integers as input and finds the  two integers in the list that sum up to a given target value.Used the "two-pointer" algorithm to solve this problem. The program should output a tuple (a, b) where a and b are two integers from the input list that sum up to the target value, or None if no such pair exists.
Open this project with intellij or eclipse and run Main. class.
On terminal put on first row array of integers with space between, on second row integer.
To set up and run a Java program locally from Git, you can follow these steps:
Clone the Git repository to your local machine using Git command line or Git GUI client. Install Java on your machine if it’s not already installed. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository. Compile the Java program using the javac command followed by the name of the Java file you want to compile. Run the compiled Java program using the java Main command. If you’re using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, you can import the cloned repository as a project and run it directly from within the IDE. By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the Java program locally using your preferred IDE. Make sure you have the necessary JDK and IDE installations before proceeding.
