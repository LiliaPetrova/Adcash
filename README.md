# Adcash
A program that takes a list of integers as input and finds the  two integers in the list that sum up to a given target value.Used the "two-pointer" algorithm to solve this problem. The program should output a tuple (a, b) where a and b are two integers from the input list that sum up to the target value, or None if no such pair exists.
